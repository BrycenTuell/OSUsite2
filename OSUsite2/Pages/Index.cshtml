        <h2>DevOps Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile planning and teamwork (user stories, sprints, boards)</li>
            <li>Git workflows (branches, pull requests, code review)</li>
            <li>Continuous Integration (automated builds, tests, feedback)</li>
            <li>Continuous Delivery basics (promoting changes safely)</li>
            <li>Automation mindset (scripts, pipelines, repeatable steps)</li>

        <h2>Tools We Use & What They Demonstrate</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Azure DevOps — Used for managing backlogs, sprint planning, and CI/CD pipelines. It shows employers you understand Agile workflows and how teams organize real projects.</li>
            <li>GitHub — Used for source control, branching, pull requests, and collaboration. It proves you can work in a shared codebase using modern Git workflows like feature branches and code reviews.</li>
            <li>Docker — Used to containerize applications so they run the same on every machine. Shows you understand containers, images, Dockerfiles, and the basics of cloud deployment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How This Translates to Entry-Level DevOps Roles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Version Control & Collaboration: Using GitHub teaches branching, merging, pull requests, and working with others in the same repo, all required in DevOps jobs.</li>
            <li>Agile Planning: Creating user stories, assigning tasks, and tracking progress in Azure DevOps is how real development teams plan sprints and organize work.</li>
            <li>CI/CD Foundations: Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions introduce automated builds and deployments, a core part of DevOps pipelines in companies.</li>
            <li>Containerization: Using Docker to build and run applications in containers shows employers you understand how software is packaged and shipped consistently across environments.</li>
            <li>Deploying to Cloud Environments: Publishing apps to Azure connects classroom projects to real cloud deployment workflows used by DevOps engineers.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting & Logs: Fixing broken pipelines, container errors, and deployment issues teaches problem-solving — one of the most important DevOps skills.</li>
        </ul>
